    "- Language models (LMs) have recently made significant advances in natural language processing, with models such as T5, LaMDA, GPT-3, and PaLM showing impressive performance on various language tasks.",
    "- Scaling up the size of the model is important for improving performance in some instances, but trained models can still be slow and costly for practical use.",
    "- Autoregressive LMs generate text by predicting each new word based on the preceding words, which is a process that cannot be parallelized and requires significant computation due to the model's large number of parameters.",
    "- In a paper presented at NeurIPS 2022, a new method called Confident Adaptive Language Modeling (CALM) was introduced to accelerate text generation by dynamically distributing computational effort across generation timesteps based on the difficulty of the next word prediction.",
    "- CALM allows for faster text generation while maintaining output quality by allocating more computational resources to harder predictions.",

    "- Local confidence-based decisions are connected to globally consistent outputs using the Learn then Test framework",
    "- CALM (Confidence-aware Long-range Memory) is a method for accelerating text generation with large language models",
    "- CALM uses user-defined consistency constraints and local per-timestep confidence thresholds to determine when to exit early during prediction",
    "- There are two types of consistency constraints: textual consistency (expected textual distance between CALM and full model outputs) and risk consistency (expected increase in loss for CALM compared to full model)",
    "- CALM was evaluated on three datasets (CNN/DM for summarization, WMT for machine translation, and SQuAD for question answering) using 8-layer encoder-decoder model and three confidence measures (softmax response, state propagation, and early-exit classifier)",
    "- CALM was able to maintain full model performance while using only a third to half of the layers on average, and in some cases as few as 1.5 layers",
    "- CALM also resulted in practical speedups, saving almost half of the compute time while maintaining output quality",
    "- CALM can be combined with other efforts to improve efficiency, such as model quantization, distillation, sparsity, effective partitioning, and distributed control flows."

    "- The BERT model uses WordPiece embeddings with a 30,000 token vocabulary and includes a special classification token, [CLS], at the beginning of every sequence",
    "- The final hidden state corresponding to the [CLS] token is used as the aggregate sequence representation for classification tasks",
    "- Sentence pairs are packed together into a single sequence and separated by a special token, [SEP], and a learned embedding is added to every token to indicate whether it belongs to sentence A or B",
    "- BERT is pre-trained using two unsupervised tasks: a masked language model (MLM) and a next sentence prediction task",
    "- The MLM task masks a randomly selected portion of the input tokens and trains the model to predict the original vocabulary ID of the masked tokens based on their context",
    "- The next sentence prediction task trains the model to understand the relationships between two sentences by predicting whether the second sentence follows the first in a given corpus",
    "- BERT has shown strong performance on a variety of natural language processing tasks, including outperforming previous state-of-the-art models on several benchmark datasets",
    "- The code and pre-trained models for BERT are publicly available on GitHub.",
    "- BERT is a language representation model called Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers",
    "- BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by conditioning on both left and right context in all layers",
    "- BERT can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications",
    "- BERT was pre-trained using two unsupervised tasks: masked language modeling and next sentence prediction",
    "- BERT outperforms all systems on the GLUE benchmark, obtaining 4.5% and 7.0% average accuracy improvement over the prior state of the art for BERT base and large, respectively",
    "- On the SQuAD v1.1 task, BERT outperforms all previous models, obtaining a new state-of-the-art F1 score of 93.2%",
    "- On the SQuAD v2.0 task, BERT outperforms all previous models, obtaining a new state-of-the-art F1 score of 88.5%"
